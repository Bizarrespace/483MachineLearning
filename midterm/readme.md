# Regression models I need to build
* Split dataset into training set and test set
  * Simple linear regression
  * Multi Linear regression 
* (Train on whole data)
  * Polynomial Linear Regression 
  * Random forest Regression
  * Decission Tree Regression
  * Suport Vector Regression(SVR) (Feature scaling)
      * Things you need to do:
        * Calculate R^2

# Classification model I need to build
* K-NN (Feature Scaling) 
* Random Forest Classification
* Decisison Tree Classification
* Kernel SVM
* Naive Bayes
  * Things you need to do:
    * Spltting dataset into training and test set
    * Feature scaling
    * Confusion Matrix
    * Calculate accuracy and confusion matrix
